# **Match3Game**
This game project was developed as a part of my final capstone project for my Computer Science course on Data Structures and Algorithms. The purpose of this project was to apply the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course to create an interactive game using Java. 

### Project Overview
The objective of this game project was to develop a game utilizing certain given data structures. The codebase provided in this repository represents a work-in-progress version of the game and does not constitute a fully finished product.
### Please note that this project is a work in progress and may not have all the intended features or a polished user interface

### Project Details
Programming Language: Java <br />
User Interface: Java Swing

### Contributions
Two of my project partners, Virginia Do and Isbah Ameer, were also involved in the development of this project. While the primary focus of our contributions revolved around the game mechanics, I also embarked on a solo endeavor to explore the Swing library, with the aim of leveraging its capabilities to create a comprehensive user interface. Because of time constraints, I was only able to get a basic version of interface developed.
